PS 95:1 O come, let us sing unto the LORD: let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation.
PS 95:2 Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and make a joyful noise unto him with psalms.
PS 95:3 For the LORD is a great God, and a great King above all gods.
PS 95:4 In his hand are the deep places of the earth: the strength of the hills is his also.
PS 95:5 The sea is his, and he made it: and his hands formed the dry land.
PS 95:6 O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the LORD our maker.
PS 95:7 For he is our God; and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. To day if ye will hear his voice,
PS 95:8 Harden not your heart, as in the provocation, and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness:
PS 95:9 When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work.
PS 95:10 Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said, It is a people that do err in their heart, and they have not known my ways:
PS 95:11 Unto whom I sware in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest.
