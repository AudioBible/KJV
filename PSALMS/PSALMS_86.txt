PS 86:1 Bow down thine ear, O LORD, hear me: for I am poor and needy.
PS 86:2 Preserve my soul; for I am holy: O thou my God, save thy servant that trusteth in thee.
PS 86:3 Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I cry unto thee daily.
PS 86:4 Rejoice the soul of thy servant: for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.
PS 86:5 For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee.
PS 86:6 Give ear, O LORD, unto my prayer; and attend to the voice of my supplications.
PS 86:7 In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou wilt answer me.
PS 86:8 Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord; neither are there any works like unto thy works.
PS 86:9 All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee, O Lord; and shall glorify thy name.
PS 86:10 For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: thou art God alone.
PS 86:11 Teach me thy way, O LORD; I will walk in thy truth: unite my heart to fear thy name.
PS 86:12 I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and I will glorify thy name for evermore.
PS 86:13 For great is thy mercy toward me: and thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell.
PS 86:14 O God, the proud are risen against me, and the assemblies of violent men have sought after my soul; and have not set thee before them.
PS 86:15 But thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion, and gracious, longsuffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth.
PS 86:16 O turn unto me, and have mercy upon me; give thy strength unto thy servant, and save the son of thine handmaid.
PS 86:17 Shew me a token for good; that they which hate me may see it, and be ashamed: because thou, LORD, hast holpen me, and comforted me.
