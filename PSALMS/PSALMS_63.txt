 PS 63:1 O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is; 
 PS 63:2 To see thy power and thy glory, so as I have seen thee in the sanctuary. 
 PS 63:3 Because thy lovingkindness is better than life, my lips shall praise thee. 
 PS 63:4 Thus will I bless thee while I live: I will lift up my hands in thy name. 
 PS 63:5 My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips: 
 PS 63:6 When I remember thee upon my bed, and meditate on thee in the night watches. 
 PS 63:7 Because thou hast been my help, therefore in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice. 
 PS 63:8 My soul followeth hard after thee: thy right hand upholdeth me. 
 PS 63:9 But those that seek my soul, to destroy it, shall go into the lower parts of the earth. 
 PS 63:10 They shall fall by the sword: they shall be a portion for foxes. 
 PS 63:11 But the king shall rejoice in God; every one that sweareth by him shall glory: but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.
